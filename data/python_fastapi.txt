FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs.

Basics:
- Define an app: app = FastAPI()
- Add routes with decorators like @app.get or @router.post
- Run with uvicorn: uvicorn src.main:app --reload

Health endpoints:
- GET /health should return a simple JSON payload to indicate service health.
